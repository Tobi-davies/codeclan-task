  <h1>Stockholm syndrome</h1>
  <p><strong>Stockholm syndrome</strong> is a condition in which hostages develop a <u>psychological </u> alliance with their captors during captivity.Emotional bonds may be formed between captors and captives, during intimate time together, but these are generally considered irrational in light of the danger or risk endured by the victims. <strong>Stockholm syndrome</strong> has never been included in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders or <i>DSM</i>, the standard tool for diagnostic of psychiatric illnesses and disorders, mainly due to the lack of a consistent body of academic research. The syndrome is extremely rare as noted by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation's Hostage Barricade Database System and Law Enforcement Bulletin estimating that fewer than 5% of kidnapping victims show evidence of Stockholm syndrome.</p>
   

  <h3>There are four key components that characterize Stockholm syndrome:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>A hostage's development of positive feelings towards the captor</li>
    <li>No previous relationship between hostage and captor</li>
    <li>
      A refusal by hostages to cooperate with police forces and other government authorities (unless the captors themselves happen to be members of police forces or government authorities).</li>
    <li>A hostage's belief in the humanity of the captor because they cease to perceive the captor as a threat when the victim holds the same values as the aggressor</li>
  </ul>
    
  
  <h4>Physical and psychological effects</h4>
  <ol>
    <li>Cognitive: confusion, blurred memory, delusion, and recurring flashbacks.</li>
    <li>Emotional: lack of feeling, fear, helplessness, hopelessness, aggression, depression, guilt, dependence on captor, and development of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).</li>
    <li>
      Social: anxiety, irritability, cautiousness, and estrangement.</li>
    <li>Physical: increase in effects of pre-existing conditions; development of health conditions due to possible restriction from food, sleep, and exposure to outdoors.</li>
  </ol>
